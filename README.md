# Mouse Tumor Data Analysis
This project analyzes a dataset containing information on tumor volume, mouse weight, gender, age, and drug regimens to evaluate treatment effects on tumor progression. Key tasks include:

1. Data Cleaning: Remove duplicate mouse entries to ensure accurate analysis.

2. Statistical Summaries: Calculate tumor volume metrics such as mean, median, and IQR for key drug regimens.

3. Visualizations:

- Generate pie charts (gender distribution of mice).

- Box plots (tumor volume distribution across regimens).

- Scatter plots (mouse weight vs. average tumor volume).

- Line plots (tumor volume vs. timepoint for a specific mouse).

4. Regression Analysis: Establish the relationship between mouse weight and average tumor volume for Capomulin treatment.

# Tools Used
- Python Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, and SciPy.

- Techniques: Data filtering, statistical computation, and visual storytelling.

# Usage
Run the included Python scripts to visualize trends and uncover statistical insights that could inform drug effectiveness.
